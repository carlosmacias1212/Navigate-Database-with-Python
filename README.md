# Navigate-Database-with-Python
In this homework assignment, our goal is to get some practice navigating a dataset, and answering some basic questions about a dataset.

# Which movie has the highest average rating, among all movies that are included in the Mystery genre, that also has at least 100 ratings?
The Usual Suspects (1995)

# Which movie has the lowest average rating, among all movies that are included in the Action genre, that also has at least 100 ratings?
Waterworld (1995)

# Consider all users who rated the movie “Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977)” a rating of 5.0. Consider all of the movie ratings that these users provided. Among these movies that were rated by at least 10 of these users, what is the movie (besides “Star Wars IV”) with the highest average rating? Such a movie could be thought of as a recommendation for users who liked the movie Toy Story. (Note that there are better ways for making movie recommendations).
Shawshank Redemption, The (1994)

# A movie recommendation is referred to as serendipitous if it (1) recommends a movie that a user would like, but (2) it is also a movie that the user would not have found for themselves. Provide an example of a serendipitous movie recommendation. (This is an open-ended question).
An example of a serendipitous movie recommendation would be if a user has previously rated several action comedy movies highly and a recommendation for an action comedy movie that they have not watched is made. This movie is recommended because it aligns with a genre that the user rates highly and is assumed to like, and it is also not a movie that they have watched.
